# CHANGELOG

## Version 1.3.2 - obfuscation adjustment

### Fix
Minor fixes for generation of obfuscations params.
Adjusted default MTU.

### Improvement
Now Jmin and Jmax can be set manually in the valid ranges.
Improved params generation validation.


## Version 1.3.1 - healthcheck

### Fix
Fixed healthcheck on custom port. Added `/status` endpoint for health check.

## Version 1.3.0 - Client traffic

### New Features
Enables monitoring of per-client traffic statistics on a given server and displays the current traffic usage in the UI. After server is stopped the data on the network adapters is reset.

- Backend: Added `get_traffic_for_server` method to parse `awg show <interface>` output and map traffic to clients by public key.
- Backend: Added `/api/servers/<server_id>/traffic` endpoint returning traffic info JSON.
- Frontend: Modified `loadServerClients` to fetch traffic and pass it to renderServerClients.
- Frontend: Updated `renderServerClients` to display received and sent traffic per client below client IP.

### API Endpoints Added

#### `/api/servers/<server_id>/traffic`
**Method**: GET<br>
**Description**: This endpoint returns traffic statistics for all clients connected to a specified server.<br>
**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "clientA": {
    "received": "2.45 MiB",
    "sent": "5.12 MiB"
  },
  "clientB": {
    "received": "0 B",
    "sent": "0 B"
  }
}
```
If the server is not found or no traffic data is available, the endpoint returns:
```json
{
  "error": "Server not found or no traffic data"
}
```
with HTTP status code 404.


## Version 1.2.0 - QR Code Feature Release

### New Features
- **QR Code Generation**: Added QR code support for client configurations
- **Clean Config Format**: Implemented clean config generation without comments for QR codes
- **Dual Config Views**: Toggle between clean (QR-ready) and full (with comments) config views
- **QR Code Download**: Export QR codes as PNG images
- **Enhanced UI**: Improved modal design with better layout and responsive design
- **Configuration Toggle**: Switch between clean and full configuration views

### API Endpoints Added

#### 1. `/api/servers/<server_id>/clients/<client_id>/config-both`
**Method**: GET<br>
**Description**: Returns both clean (without comments) and full (with comments) client configurations in a single request<br>
**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "server_id": "abc123",
  "client_id": "xyz789",
  "client_name": "Client Name",
  "clean_config": "[Interface]\nPrivateKey = ...",
  "full_config": "# AmneziaWG Client Configuration\n[Interface]\n...",
  "clean_length": 450,
  "full_length": 600
}
```
**Purpose**: Optimized endpoint for QR code generation that returns both versions to reduce API calls

#### 2. Enhanced `/api/servers/<server_id>/clients/<client_id>/config`
**Method**: GET<br>
**Description**: Now serves clean configuration (without comments) for direct download<br>
